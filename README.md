# Rimp(Reimplementer)

`rimp` is a Cross-Platform command-line tool which makes working with files/folders you need regularly much easier, by allowing you to tag and access them in the future only by their tags.


## :thinking: Why?
I wanted a tool that allows you to:

- Tag files/folders using the command line 

- Paste those files/folders elsewhere with one simple command.

- Remove or update an existing tag
